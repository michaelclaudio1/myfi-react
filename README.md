# MyFi - React/Node.js

This is a fullstack React project hosted on AWS, using various AWS services like RDS (database), Lambda (API), Amplify (hosting), and Cognito (authentication).

The purpose of this application is to create a personal finance dashboard application with eventual integration with Plaid APIs to display real banking transactional data.

This is a rewrite of the MyFi-Nextjs repo to further my familiarity with plain React, as well as to expand my knowledge of AWS services and the AWS SDK.
